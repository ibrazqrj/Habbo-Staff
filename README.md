# Habbo Index Project 🛋️

## Introduction ℹ️

The Habbo Index project was created during my school studies as I am learning about HTML and CSS. It served as an opportunity to apply my newly acquired knowledge and skills in web development.

## Technologies Used 🛠️

- **VSCode:** Used as the primary code editor for development.
- **HTML, CSS, and JS:** The project is based on these fundamental web technologies.

## Live Demo 🚀
